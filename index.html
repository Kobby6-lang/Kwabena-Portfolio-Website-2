                <span>Hi I'm Kwabena Osei-Tutu</span></h1>
            <h3><span>3D Artist</span> based in London</h3>
            <p>
                I am in my third year at London South Bank University, pursuing a BA (Hons) in Games Design.
                I have honed my skills in 3D modelling using Maya and Blender, and I am eager to apply my expertise professionally.
                My experience working as a waiter at Shoryu Restaurant has equipped me with valuable customer service skills and a strong work ethic.<br><br>
                I am seeking a placement in the video games industry to leverage my 3D modelling capabilities and further my career in game design.
                I'm also getting my hands on coding to have more options in my career path.
                My interests are watching anime, reading manga, light novels, playing games, and playing badminton.
