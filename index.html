                <span>Hi, I'm Kwabena Osei-Tutu</span></h1>
            <h3><span>3D Artist</span> based in London</h3>
            <p>
                I am in my third year at London South Bank University, pursuing a BA (Hons) in Games Design.
                I have honed my skills in 3D modelling using Maya and Blender, and I am eager to apply my expertise professionally.
                My experience working as a waiter at Shoryu Restaurant has equipped me with valuable customer service skills and a strong work ethic.<br><br>
                I am seeking a placement in the video games industry to leverage my 3D modelling capabilities and further my career in game design.
                I'm also getting my hands on coding to have more options in my career path.
                My interests are watching anime, reading manga, light novels, playing games, and playing badminton.

                    The intricate detailing results in a model that is visually stunning yet overly complex, 
                    potentially impacting performance in rendering or game applications.

                <p>
                    For my second year project, I built a wooden slot machine for a squirrel game. 
                    The design was meant to fit the theme and provide an engaging element for players. 
                    The use of wood added a nice touch to the game's look.

                    I  tried to make a glowing sword that shines with light. 
                    I thought it would look cool and will stand out in the game. 
                    The glow adds a neat effect, making the sword special and eye-catching.
